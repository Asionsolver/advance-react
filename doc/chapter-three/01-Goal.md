# Goal

> In the previous chapter, we explored how passing elements as props can improve the performance of our apps. However, performance enhancements are not the most common use of this pattern. In fact, they are more of a nice side effect and relatively unknown. The biggest use case this pattern solves is actually flexibility and configuration of components.
>
> Let's continue our investigation into how React works. This time, we're going to build a simple "button with icon" component. What could possibly be complicated about this one, right? But in the process of building it, you'll find out: How elements as props can drastically improve configuration concerns for such components. How conditional rendering of components influences performance. When a component passed as props is rendered exactly. How to set default props for components passed as props by using the cloneElement function, and what the downsides of that are.
