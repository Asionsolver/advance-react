# Goals

> Let's dive right in, shall we? And let's talk about performance right away: it's one of the most important topics these days when it comes to building applications, and as a result, it's an overarching theme of this book.
> And when it comes to React and performance in React, it's crucial to understand re-renders and their influence. How they are triggered, how they propagate through the app, what happens when a component re-renders and why, and why we need them in the first place.
> This chapter introduces these concepts, which will be explored in more detail in the next few chapters. And to make it more fun, let's make it in the form of an investigation. Let's introduce a very common performance problem in an app, look at what's happening because of it, and how to fix it with a very simple composition technique. While doing so, you will learn:

- What a re-render is, and why we need it.
- What the initial source of all re-renders is.
- How React propagates re-renders through the app.
- The big re-renders myth and why props changing by themselves
  doesn't matter.
- The "moving state down" technique to improve performance.
- Why hooks can be dangerous when it comes to re-renders.
