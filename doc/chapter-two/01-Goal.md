# Goals

> In the previous chapter, we explored how state changes trigger downstream re-renders in our apps and how this can be dealt with using the "moving state down" pattern. However, the example there was relatively simple, and the state was pretty isolated. So moving it into a component was easy. What are our options when the situation is a bit more complicated?

> It's time to continue our exploration of how re-renders work, do another performance investigation, and dig deeper into the details. In this chapter, you'll learn:

- How passing components as props can improve the performance of our apps.
- How exactly React triggers re-renders.
- Why components as props are not affected by re-renders.
- What an Element is, how it's different from a Component, and why it's important to know that distinction.
- The basics of React reconciliation and diffing.
- What the "children as props" pattern is, and how it can prevent re-renders.
